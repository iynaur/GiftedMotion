GiftedMotion 1.5
============

Introduction
============

This simply is a "better version" of the old GiftedMotion animator program, created by OnyxBits. 

Eventually this'll develop into more of a "Version 2.0" of GiftedMotion, through slow additions. I think the ultimate goal is to create an applet version and perhaps specialize the software to gif editing and compositing, rather than the original purpose of simply compiling gifs from files.

To Do
=====
* Get a new name
* UNDO!!!!
* Add JMF or something so it can decode videos to gif
* Add a youtube downloader, in conjunction with the aforementioned decoder
* Maybe add an image editor (ganked from someone else's project), though that could be outsourced to the OS default.
* 3D? Ehhh.. nah.
* Load multiple projects in one workspace and allow copying of frames
* Get a faster gif encoder, holy crap.
* Get a less buggy gif decoder, amazingly Java's pack-in one is rubbish.
* Create an in-browser applet (or webstart)
* Probably overkill but allow publication directly to reddit or imgur

Differences from Vanilla Version
=================

* Windows can't float away, forever unusable
* Buttons are more accurately disabled/enabled based on state
* Resources file edited to be more logical. I think OnyxBits is German.
* Removed crufy languages that really aren't necessary.
* Fixed annoying bug in the sequence editor
* Added drag-n-drop from the filesystem
* Added a tool system
* Rotate tool
* Resize tool
* Image deoptimizer
* Crippledly loads malformed gifs, whereas the original doesn't at all
* Onionskinner (userful for creating stabilizations)
* Able to add more frames during a project, instead of overwriting all of your work.
